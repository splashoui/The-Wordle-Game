From wikipedia:

>Wordle is a web-based word game developed by Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the US television game show Lingo. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.

## How to play?

The rules are very simple: You need to guess the 5 letters secret word in 6 attempts. To get started, just enter "y" and type any 5 letters word for the first line. If the letter is guessed correctly and is in the correct place, it will be highlighted in green, if the letter is in the word, but in the wrong place - in yellow, and if the letter is not in the word, it will remain gray. Let's try to guess the secret word in 6 attempts.
